This project is a full-stack application built using the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) stack. The application allows users to list properties for sale and for buyers to view and express interest in those properties.

Project Structure
The project is divided into two main directories: backend and frontend.

Backend
The backend is built using Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB. It includes controllers, models, routes, and services to handle user authentication and property management.
